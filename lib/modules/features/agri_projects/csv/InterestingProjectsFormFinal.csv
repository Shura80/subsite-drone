For example, a pig displaying a reduced number and duration of feed visits, or even a lack of visits or too great pauses between visits, will be timely signalled and the pig farmer can intervention quickly.

plant VOCs has so far mainly concentrated on the effects of individual stresses on induced BVOCs. The
extensive knowledge that these studies have yielded now pave the way for an exciting step, i.e. to study how plants respond to combinations of stresses.

","This research project investigates the relation between the diversity of crops and cultivation methods above ground and the biodiversity of organisms below ground, and evaluates the significance of this for the life support functions of the soil, such as the retention of nutrients and the suppression of diseases. 

The results reveal large differences between various categories of soil type and land use, and significant effects of farm management on most groups of organisms. The largest proportion of the measured biomass consists of bacteria. This biomass is high in grassland, lower in arable land and very low in horticultural soils. Across the same series of soils, the species composition of microarthropods varies in a way that reflects an increasing intensity of use: the diversity of nematodes changes and bacterial activity rises as the intensity of use increases (measured in livestock units per hectare).

","In the Mediterranean basin, rain-fed vineyards often suffer of too severe water stress which might preclude an adequate vegetative growth able to support a proper reproductive development ensuring a profitable activity. Strategies to alleviate severe soil water deficit conditions and improve the whole vineyard water use efficiency WUE are needed. The present proposal should quantify the effects of different field practices to optimize the vineyard water balance both, at the supply and demand level","Se plantea reducir el déficit hídrico del suelo al que se ven sometidos los viñedos en secano mediante el riego con aguas no convencionales provenientes de la depuración de los vertidos municipales.

Se optimizará la demanda de agua por parte del cultivo de la vid incrementando la eficiencia en su uso. Los restos de poda serán empleados para establecer un acolchado orgánico del suelo para reducir la evaporación de agua desde el suelo.

","The project should quantify the effects of different field practices to optimize the vineyard water balance both, at the supply and demand level. Municipal treated waste water will be used to mitigate drought stress. However, the short and mid-term detrimental effects of salt stress should be also taken into account and quantified.

Pruning waste will be used in the vineyard orchard floor, as an organic inexpensive mulching and its effects on the vineyard evapotranspiration will be quantified. Another possible approach to increase WUE is managing canopy exposure to sunlight by means of the training system.

FORK- The Flemish Organic Research & Knowledge Network
(BBN, CCBT, NOBL)

In the Flemish organic sector, a specific network has been established for research, knowledge exchange and implementation: the Flemish Organic Research & Knowledge Network (FORK). 

Key principles 
The following key principles are at the heart of the FORK network:

-	Co- creation of knowledge and research: needs and goals are understood by all actors and they work together (each with their competences) to reach the goals, the facilitator/multiplier connects the different actors and makes sure the role of each actor is clear
-	Multi actor involvement: all stakeholders have an equal status in terms of knowledge sharing
-	Farmers at the drivers seat: the knowledge needs of the farmers are the starting point, the multiplier makes sure the right questions are asked to get to results
-	Methodologies and processes are very important to get to actual results in the field: every actor needs to feel involved and feel ownership of the process.
-	Dissemination of results in the different phases of the proces is tailormade for the farmers and scientists (e.g. through the CCBT website and newsletter, the NOBL yearly research book on organic farming and database, Org E-prints, the Biokennis website and newsletters, conventional technical magazines,…)
-	Co-operation with regional and European partners (Tp Organics, Biokennis,…)
-	Continuity is needed to get to the heart of the knowledge need and to get the right results ( network activities, connecting activities, financial support,…)

Who are we?
The Fork network involves three partners: BBN (organic farmers’ networks, coordinated by the farmers’ organisation BioForum), CCBT (Coordination Centre for Applied Reasearch and Extension on Organic Agriculture) and NOBL (Network for Organic Food and Farming research). 

BBN: There are now 7 farmers’ networks: dairy cattle, beef cattle, vegetable & arable crops, goats, poultry, berries and greenhouse crops. They are coordinated by BioForum, the sector organisation of the organic sector in Flanders. There is a close cooperation with different actors and networks relevant for knowledge exchange and research in Flanders and Europe. The topics are all farmrelated ( technical, marketing related). ( cfr paper: ‘BioForum as multiplier’)

CCBT involves 6 applied research stations in Flanders that also do advisory work: Inagro, Department for organic crop production and PIBO campus (vegetables & arable crops), PCG (Greenhouse crops and herbs), PPK (berries), PC Fruit (Pome and stone fruit), Proefbedrijf Pluimveehouderij (poultry laying hens), and the private advisor service for animal husbandry Wim Govaerts & Luk Sobry. 

NOBL is a network of 16 institutes (universities and associations with university colleges, the Institute for Agricultural and Fisheries Research (ILVO) ,  applied research stations,  farmers’ and consumers’ organisations and the Department for Agriculture and Fisheries). 

Other Partnerships :
These networks work closely together with Biokennis and TP Organics and with the partners of the Flemish Platform for Agricultural Research (Platform voor Landbouwonderzoek).

Biokennis: Under the name bioKennis, the Dutch and Flemish research and knowledge networks established a joint partnership and website Biokennis.org to communicate results from research on organic farming (including the projects funded by the Ministry of Economic Affairs and the Government of Flanders). On the website, Flemish and Dutch organic research results are shared in a language that farmers understand and in a format where farmers immediately see what the lessons learned are. 

TP Organics: Recently, the FORK network was officially recognised by TPOrganics as national mirror of TP Organics and Member of the European Technology Platform “TPOrganics"".TP Organics is the European Technology Platform (ETP) for organic food and farming research. It integrates views of the organic sector and civil society to represent a broad perspective on research and development priorities that can leverage organic food and farming’s potential to address contemporary challenges. 

The Platform for Agricultural Research unites universities (KU Leuven and UGhent), the Institute for Agricultural and Fisheries Research (ILVO), university colleges (University College Ghent and Thomas Moore Institute), the experimental stations,  farmers’ organizations (Boerenbond, Algemeen Boerensyndicaat and BioForum), the Departments of Agriculture and Fisheries, Economy, Science and Innovation and Environment, Nature and Energy and the Agency for Innovation by Science and Technology (IWT).",
